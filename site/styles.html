		<h3>Pernicious anaemia</h3>
		<p>
			
			 Th is is caused by autoimmune attack on the gastric
			mucosa leading to atrophy of the stomach. Th e wall
			of the stomach becomes thin, with a plasma cell and
			lymphoid infi ltrate of the lamina propria. Intestinal
			metaplasia may occur. Th ere is achlorhydria and
			secretion of IF is absent or almost absent. Serum
			gastrin levels are raised. Helicobater pylori infection
			may initiate an autoimmune gastritis which presents
			in younger subjects as iron defi ciency and in the
			elderly as pernicious anaemia.
			 More females than males are aff ected (1.6 : 1),
			with a peak occurrence at 60 years, and there may
			be associated autoimmune disease including the
			autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (Table 5.4 ).
			Th e disease is found in all races but is most common
			in northern Europeans and tends to occur in families. Th ere is also an increased incidence of carcinoma of the stomach (approximately 2 – 3% of all
			cases of pernicious anaemia)
		</p>

	<section id="Section2">
		<h3>Neural tube defect</h3>
		<p>
			
			 Folate or B 12 defi ciency in the mother predisposes
			to neural tube defect (NTD) (anencephaly, spina
			bifi da or encephalocoele) in the fetus (Fig. 5.10 ).
			Th e lower the maternal serum or red cell folate or
			serum B 12 levels (even when these are in the normal
			range), the higher the incidence of NTDs. Moreover,
			supplementation of the diet with folic acid at the
			time of conception and in early pregnancy reduces
			the incidence of NTD by 75%. Th e exact mechanism is uncertain but is thought to be related to
			build - up of homocysteine and S - adenosyl homocysteine in the fetus which may impair methylation
			of various proteins and lipids. A common polymorphism in the enzyme 5,10 - methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (5,10 - MTHFR) (677C → T) (see
			 p. 367 ) results in higher serum homocysteine and
			lower serum and red cell folate levels compared
			with controls. Th e incidence of the mutation is
			higher in the parents and fetus with NTD than in
			controls. 
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id="Section3">
		<h3>Malignant diseases</h3>
		<p>
			
			 Various associations have been found between folate
			status or polymorphisms in folate metabolizing
			enzymes and malignant diseases such as colon or
			breast cancer and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in
			childhood. In most but not all, reduced folate status
			has been associated with an increased risk of malignancy. Large - scale studies of prophylactic folic acid
			undertaken for cardiovascular disease, have generally not shown in any diff erence in cancer incidence
			between those taking folic acid and controls. 
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id="Section4">
		<h3>Pathogenesis</h3>
		<p>
			
			 HS is usually caused by defects in the proteins
			involved in the vertical interactions between the
			membrane skeleton and the lipid bilayer of the red
			cell (Table 6.3 ; see Fig. 2.12 ). Th e loss of membrane
			may be caused by the release of parts of the lipid
			bilayer that are not supported by the skeleton. In
			HS, the marrow produces red cells of normal biconcave shape but these lose membrane and become
			increasingly spherical (loss of surface area relative to
			volume) as they circulate through the spleen and
			the rest of the RE system. Ultimately, the spherocytes are unable to pass through the splenic microcirculation where they die prematurely. 
		</p>
	</section>
	<section id="Section5">
			<h3>Clinical features</h3>
		<p>
		
			 The inheritance is autosomal dominant with variable expression; rarely it may be autosomal recessive.
			The anaemia can present at any age from infancy to
			old age. Jaundice is typically fl uctuating and is particularly marked if the haemolytic anaemia is associated with Gilbert ’ s disease (a defect of hepatic
			conjugation of bilirubin); splenomegaly occurs in
			most patients. Pigment gallstones are frequent (Fig.
			 6.2 ); aplastic crises, usually precipitated by parvovirus infection, may cause a sudden increase in severity of anaemia (see Fig. 22.5 ).
