I get derailed all the time during studies but i whatever happens i get back and continue reading.

Selfishness comes with wanting more, wanting more comes with disatisfaction, disafction comes with envy, envy brings
frustration, frustration leads to exhaustions and the end you might not recognize who you've become.
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie_
whenever you wake up, that is your morning;
the world calls to you;
there are many broken things to be mended;

there are tanished things to be published;
the world is calling on you.

 The tragedy is that the tree can be cut down, but not rooted out.

Yesterday may be bad, make a good use of today and your tomorrow will be better.

The darker things get out there, the brighter God glows within.&quot;
